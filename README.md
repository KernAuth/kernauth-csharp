# KernAuth C# example

Paste the public app ID and public key from Developers into `Program.cs`. .NET 8. The project file brings in BouncyCastle.Cryptography.

## Start

```csharp
var app = new KernAuth(
    "https://api.kernauth.com",
    "__PUBLIC_APP_ID__",
    "__PUBLIC_KEY__");
```

Type the license at the prompt. `KERN_LICENSE_KEY` skips the prompt. The library reads the Windows user SID and checks the signature. The program then asks the server again every minute. If the session was ended, the key was paused, or this computer is blocked, it prints that message and exits.

## Run

```
dotnet run -- --test-vectors
dotnet run
```

A modified program can still skip the check.
